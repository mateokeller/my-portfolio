          Finding creative solutions to problems is something I have always
          enjoyed. As a kid I loved playing around with things that where
          broken, learning how they worked, and fixing them. When I finished
          high school, I knew exactly what I wanted my carrer to be. <br />
          I am finishing up my degree at UADE, where I learned how to apply
          critical thinking and problem-solving strategies to complex projects.
          I'm also working on several projects at a time in order to learn more
          front-end development. <br />
